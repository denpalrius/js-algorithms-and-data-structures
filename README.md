# Javascript Algorithms and data structures.

These are practice algorithms imlemented using Javascript.

I also decided to use Typescript in some of them for better statically typed code.

Some include multiple recognised patterns from different sources.

## Running the JS scripts

```js
$ node './script/name.js'
```

## Running the TS scripts

```sh
$ npm install -g ts-node
```

```sh
$ ts-node './script/name.ts'
```
